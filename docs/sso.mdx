description: "TrueFoundry allows your team to utilize an SSO with your Identity Provider (IdP) by leveraging OpenID Connect (OIDC) or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). TrueFoundry SSO integration provides a seamless way to sign in with your own IdPs and also eliminates the need for employees to enter credentials to prove their identities repeatedly."

Truefoundry can integrate with the following IdP providers:

1. **GSuite**
