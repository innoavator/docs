# Creating a Volume

After a brief moment, the deployment should become active, and your Volume Dashboard will transform to appear as follows:

You can create a volume following the flow above, however, a few key things to understand in the Volume Creation form are as follows:

### Workspace

You can read more about workspace and how to create it [here](doc:key-concepts#creating-a-workspace).

<Info>
  This localized approach ensures that the volume's data is accessible only to the applications that are part of the same environment, enhancing security and organization.

## Dynamically Provisioned Volumes

### Storage Classes

Storage classes provide a way to specify the type of storage that should be provisioned for a Volume. These storage classes differ in their characteristics, such as performance, durability, and cost. You can select the appropriate storage class for your Volume while creating it, from the Storage Class dropdown menu.

The specific storage classes available will depend on the cloud provider you are using and what is preconfigured by the Infra team.

<Info />

You will usually see the following options in the storage classes based on the cloud provider:

#### AWS Storage Classes

## Statically Provisioned Volumes

Statically provisioned volume enable us to mount an already existing volume to workloads on truefoundry.

To create a statically provisioned volume:

* Find the PersistentVolume name you want to mount.
* In the form choose `Statically Provisioned`
* Enter the Persistent Volume Name and click on Submit

## Copy Volume FQN (Fully Qualified Name)

A volume FQN helps identify a Volume uniquely in Truefoundry. You will need it for mounting Volumes to your deployment

A volume FQN looks something like: `tfy-volume://your-volume:your-workspace:your-volume-name`

You can copy the Volume FQN from here:
