title: "Passing Files/Artifacts between tasks"
description: "In Workflow, FlyteFile and FlyteDirectory are special types representing files and directory that can be passed between tasks in a workflow. It helps manage and track files and directories, ensuring that they can be accessed and moved across different execution environments."

## Passing files across tasks

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.workflow import (
      PythonTaskConfig,
      TaskPythonBuild,
      task,
      workflow,
      FlyteFile
  )
  from truefoundry.deploy import Resources

  task_config = PythonTaskConfig(
      image=TaskPythonBuild(
          python_version="3.9",
          pip_packages=["truefoundry[workflow]==0.4.7rc0"],
      ),
      resources=Resources(cpu_request=0.45),
      service_account="default",
  )

  @task(task_config=task_config)
  def create_file() -> FlyteFile:
      file_path = "/tmp/sample.txt"
      with open(file_path, "w") as f:
          f.write("Hello World!")
      return FlyteFile(file_path)

  @task(task_config=task_config)
  def read_and_print_file(flyte_file: FlyteFile):
      with open(flyte_file, "r") as f:
          content = f.read()
          print("File content:", content)
          

  @workflow
  def simple_file_workflow():
      file = create_file()
      read_and_print_file(flyte_file=file)

  if __name__ == "__main__": 
      simple_file_workflow()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* In the above example we are creating a `sample.txt` file in a `create_file` task and then returning that file as FlyteFile and then in `read_and_print_file` task we are taking the flyteFile as input and then printing the content of the file.

## Passing directory across tasks

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.workflow import (
      PythonTaskConfig,
      TaskPythonBuild,
      task,
      workflow,
      FlyteDirectory
  )
  from truefoundry.deploy import Resources

  task_config = PythonTaskConfig(
      image=TaskPythonBuild(
          python_version="3.9",
          pip_packages=["truefoundry[workflow]==0.4.7rc0"],
      ),
      resources=Resources(cpu_request=0.45),
      service_account="default",
  )

  @task(task_config=task_config)
  def create_directory() -> FlyteDirectory:
      import os

      dir_path = "/tmp/sample_directory"
      os.makedirs(dir_path, exist_ok=True)
      
      # Create multiple text files in the directory
      for i in range(3):
          with open(os.path.join(dir_path, f"file_{i}.txt"), "w") as f:
              f.write(f"Content of file {i}\n")

      return FlyteDirectory(dir_path)

  @task(task_config=task_config)
  def read_and_print_directory(directory: FlyteDirectory) -> str:
      import os

      # List all files in the directory
      for filename in os.listdir(directory):
          file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
          with open(file_path, "r") as f:
              content = f.read()
              print(f"Contents of {filename}:")
              print(content)
      return "Done reading and printing the directory."

  @workflow
  def simple_directory_workflow():
      directory = create_directory()
      read_and_print_directory(directory=directory)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* In the above example, we are creating multiple files in `/tmp/sample_directory` directory in `create_directory` task and then we are passing this directory in `read_and_print_directory` task to print the files in that directory and the content of these files.
