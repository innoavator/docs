## Create new or connect an existing Kubernetes cluster

TrueFoundry offers support for the three major cloud providers: AWS EKS, GCP GKE, and Azure AKS, as well as Generic Kubernetes clusters.

For the complete range of platform features, it is recommended to use one of the three major cloud providers. Please note that Generic clusters may not support all the platform features, such as service exposure, autoscaling, GPUs, and more.

You can refer to these guides to connect your cluster based on the cloud you are using:

1. Connect an [AWS EKS](doc:docs/overview) cluster to TrueFoundry
2. Connect an [Azure AKS](doc:docs/overview-2) cluster to TrueFoundry
3. Connect a [GCP GKE](doc:overview-1) cluster to TrueFoundry

## Additional setup (Optional)

1. **Environments:** You can use the environments feature to tag your cluster with different environments like dev, staging, or prod. You can set up environments under the “Environment tab in Settings”. Once an environment is created you can click on edit cluster, select the environments, and hit the save button. [Setup Environments](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/environments)
2. **Docker Registry Integration**: TrueFoundry needs to access your Docker registry to save images built for deploying code or repositories and to deploy images from the registry to one of your connected workspaces. [Integrate Docker Registry](doc:integrations-docker-registry)
