title: "Adding pre and post build scripts"
description: "For a control plane installation, it is possible to add custom scripts which can run before and after your build/push process. This is being used to give more flexibility in terms of modifying the total behaviour of the build process and determining the result of the build pipeline."
---

## Adding script in the build pipeline

1. A script can be added before the build and post the build-and-push process.

2. To do this edit your `truefoundry` helm chart and configure the section of the `tfyBuild.truefoundryWorkflows.preBuild` and `tfyBuild.truefoundryWorkflows.postBuild`

3. Following is an example

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash bash
     tfyBuild:
       truefoundryWorkflows:
         preBuild:
           image:
             tag: latest
             repository: ubuntu
           script: |
             #!/bin/bash

             echo "Running pre-build script..."
             # your steps can come here
             echo "Finishing pre-build script."
           command:
             - /bin/bash
           enabled: true
         postBuild:
           image:
             tag: latest
             repository: ubuntu
           script: |
             #!/bin/bash

             echo "Running post-build script..."
             # your steps can come here
             echo "Finishing post-build script."
           command:
             - /bin/bash
           enabled: true
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Each build pipeline is allowed to run for max 14400 seconds post which the build will be declared as failed. User needs to ensure that the pre-build and post-build steps don't exceed the given time. Each step in itself is allowed to run for max 5400 seconds.
</Info>

4. Each step can refer to few inputs -

   1. Build Source - `{{inputs.parameters.buildSource}}`
   2. Build config - `{{inputs.parameters.buildConfig}}`
   3. Docker registry URL - `{{inputs.parameters.dockerRegistryURL}}`
   4. Docker registry username - `{{inputs.parameters.dockerRegistryUsername}}`
   5. Docker registry password - `{{inputs.parameters.dockerRegistryPassword}}`
   6. Docker image repository - `{{inputs.parameters.dockerRepo}}`
   7. Docker image tag - `{{inputs.parameters.dockerTag}}`

5. An example of using this -

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash bash
     postBuild:
       image:
         tag: latest
         repository: ubuntu
       script: >
         #!/bin/bash

         REGISTRY="{{inputs.parameters.dockerRegistryURL}}"  REPOSITORY="{{inputs.parameters.dockerRepo}}" TAG="{{inputs.parameters.dockerTag}}" IMAGE=$REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$TAG

         echo "Registry URL is "$REGISTRY
       command:
         - /bin/bash
       enabled: true
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Currently docker CLI is not supported in the pre-build script as it can't connect to any daemon.
