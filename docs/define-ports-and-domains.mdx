title: "Define Ports and Domains"
description: "When you create a Service, you need to specify the ports that the Service will listen on. You can decide to expose a port in which case you will have to attach a domain to the service."
---

### Not exposing the port

If you do not expose a service, you get a URL of the form `servicename-workspacename.svc.cluster.local:port` which can only be called from services within the cluster.

### Exposing the port

This will enable the service to be called from anywhere using the endpoint - other users or services living outside your cluster will also be able to access it. In this case, you will need to map a domain URL to your service. TrueFoundry supports both host-based routing and path-based routing.

If you use host-based routing, two services s1 and s2 will have URLs of the form `s1.yourdomain.com` and `s2.yourdomain.com`.

In the case of path-based routing, the URLs will be of the form `yourdomain.com/s1` and `yourdomain.com/s2`. If you decide to enable path-based routing, please ensure the application that you have deployed supports path-based routing.

Domains are configured in the cluster. You can view which domains are accessible to you from [here](doc:define-ports-and-domains#identifying-available-domains).

**Host-based routing will be preferred especially if you are deploying some UI-based applications.**

## Configuring the Port for your Service

### Via the User Interface (UI)

### Via the Python SDK

The `Service` class has a `ports` argument where you can pass a list of `Port` objects. Each `Port` object represents a port that the service will listen on. In the `Port` field you can specify the **`Port Number`**, host for your **`Endpoint`** and **`Path`** (Optional)

<Info>
  Providing a host value depends on the base domain urls configured in the cluster settings, you can learn how to find the base domain urls available to you [here](doc:define-ports-and-domains#identifying-available-domains)

  For e.g. If your base domain url is `*.truefoundry.your-org.com` then a valid value can be `fastapi-your-workspace-8000.truefoundry.your-org.com`.

  Alternatively if you have a non wildcard based domain url e.g. `truefoundry.your-org.com`, then a valid value can be `truefoundry.your-org.com/fastapi-your-workspace-8000`
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  import logging

  from truefoundry.deploy import Build, Service, DockerFileBuild, Port

  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  service = Service(
      name="your-service",
      image=Build(build_spec=DockerFileBuild()),
  +   ports=[
  +       Port(
  +           port=8080,
  +           # Uses subdomain based routing
  +           host="fastapi-your-workspace-8080.your-organization.com",
  +           # Alternatively we can use path based routing - E.g.
  +           # host="your-site.your-organization.com",
  +           path="/fastapi/v1/"
  +       )
  +   ]
  )
  service.deploy(workspace_fqn="YOUR_WORKSPACE_FQN")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## What if you don't know which port to use?

Usually, most of the commonly used applications will come with a way to define the port. We have listed it for some of the most commonly used frameworks in ML.

**FastAPI (Uvicorn)** - Default port is 8000. This can be overridden using the command `uvicorn main:app --port 8001`

**Gradio App** - Launch your Gradio app as follows and enter the port number 8080.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  gradio.app.launch(server_name="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now you need to specify the same port number in the service configuration. In this case `8080`

**Streamlit** - Default port is 8501.

## Adding Basic authentication to Service

Ideally when deploying a `Service` it is a good idea to protect publicly exposed ports using some form of authentication. You can add a username password based authentication to your endpoints or JWT-based authentication to your services.

### Via the User Interface (UI)

### Via the Python SDK

We can add basic (username and password) authentication to a **Port** of the **Service** in the Python definition using `truefoundry.deploy.BasicAuthCreds` )

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.deploy import Build, Service, Port, BasicAuthCreds, DockerFileBuild

  service = Service(
      name="your-service",
      image=Build(build_spec=DockerFileBuild()),
      ports=[
          Port(
              port=8080,
              host="fastapi-my-workspace-8080.truefoundry.my-org.com",
  +           auth=BasicAuthCreds(
  +                username="hello",
  +                password="pass"
  +           )
          )
      ]
  )
  service.deploy(workspace_fqn="YOUR_WORKSPACE_FQN")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Sending request to your Authenticated Endpoint

Upon deploying the service, the endpoint will now display a padlock ðŸ”’ icon, indicating that authentication is required for access.

![](/images/docs/76d8e16-protected-endpoint.png)

### Browser Access

When attempting to access the endpoint from a web browser, you will be prompted to enter your credentials.

![](/images/docs/465deac-browser-access.png)

### Python Access

When using Python, you can pass the credentials in the following manner:

```
import requests

endpoint = 'https://fastapi-my-workspace-8080.truefoundry.my-org.com/'

response = requests.get(endpoint, auth=('hello', 'pass'))
```

### Curl Access

When using cURL, you'll need to include the credentials as part of the command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  curl -v -X GET --user hello:pass https://fastapi-my-workspace-8080.truefoundry.my-org.com/
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Adding JWT Authentication to Your Service

You can configure JWT-based authentication for your services hosted on TrueFoundry to ensure that only authenticated traffic can access your endpoints.

The JWT token is sent as part of HTTP requests, and your service verifies it using a public key from the Identity Providerâ€™s (IDP) JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). This ensures the token is valid and untampered, allowing authentication based on its claims.

### Integrating Third-Party Identity Providers

Identity providers like Amazon Cognito or Azure AD manage user authentication and issue JWTs. To validate these tokens, you need to configure a **Custom JWT Auth** integration that specifies:

* **Issuer URL** â€“ The trusted identity provider.
* **JWKS URI** â€“ The endpoint for fetching public keys used in token validation.

### Creating a Custom JWT Auth Integration

1. **Go to the Integrations Page** and add a new **Custom JWT Auth** integration.

2. **Provide the following details:**

   * **Issuer**
   * **JWKS URI**

3. *(Optional)* If you want to enable OAuth2-based login for services using this integration:

   * Select **OAuth2 Client Configuration**.

   * Fill in the following fields from your OAuth2 provider:

     * **Client ID**
     * **Client Secret**
     * **Authorization URL**
     * **Token URL**
     * **Scopes** (e.g., `openid`, `email`, etc.)

Once configured, your service will authenticate incoming requests based on JWT claims, ensuring secure and verified access.

***

### Setting Up Authentication Providers

To integrate JWT authentication, you need to configure an identity provider such as **Amazon Cognito, Okta, Google OAuth2, or Microsoft Entra ID**. Each provider has a slightly different setup, but the key steps remain the same:

* Create or use an existing application within the provider.
* Retrieve the **Client ID, Client Secret**, and **OpenID configuration**.
* Configure the **Issuer, JWKS URI, Authorization URL, and Token URL** in TrueFoundry.
* Set up **scopes** required for authentication.

Below are detailed steps for specific providers.

### Enabling JWT Authentication in Your Service

Once you have set up the **Custom JWT Auth** integration, you can enable authentication in your service deployment.

#### Steps:

1. **Enable Custom Security Rule:**

   * Navigate to the **Security** settings of your service.
   * Select **Custom Security Rule** and choose the JWT authentication integration from the dropdown.

2. **Enable Login (if required):**

   * If your service requires **OAuth2-based login** (typically for frontend applications), enable the **"Enable Login"** option.
   * This allows users to log in using the OAuth2 provider configured in the integration.

3. **Verify Token Claims (Optional):**

   * You can enforce additional security by verifying claims in the token.
   * Define **accepted values per key** to ensure only valid tokens are allowed.
   * **Example:** Restrict access to users with emails from `truefoundry.com`:
     ```
     "email": "*@truefoundry.com"
     ```

<Frame caption="Sample JWT Auth Config while deploying a service">
  <img src="/images/docs/cb15aaa163ed15b5782b04443f13a4ff591b596d8f6e92942a1070b8a8bcf85b-Screenshot_2025-03-10_at_5.41.50_AM.png" />
</Frame>

If **OAuth2-based login** is enabled, you must configure the **Redirect URL** in your OAuth2 provider settings.

* After deploying the service, the **Redirect URL** will be displayed on the deployment page.
* Copy this URL and add it to your OAuth2 providerâ€™s **redirect URIs** section.

<Frame caption="redirect URL for OAuth2">

</Frame>

### Sending request to your Authenticated Endpoint

While sending request to the authenticated, you need to provide the token in the `Authorization`header. This header carries the token, allowing your service to verify and authenticate the request based on the credentials and claims present in the JWT.

Here is an example of how to send a request using curl, a common command-line tool used for making HTTP requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  curl -X GET "https://your-service-endpoint.truefoundry.cloud/api/data" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_HERE"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Unauthenticated requests would return `403`.

## Specifying Host

When we deploy services, we often want to put them behind a well-defined recognizable URL instead of load balancer URLs or IP addresses. E.g.`https://app.your-organization.com` or `https://your-site.your-organization.com/app/v1/`. There are two steps involved in this:

1. If your organization owns domains, integrate them before proceeding. For instructions, please refer to the following [guide](doc:setting-up-domain)
2. Construct endpoint URLs on top of your domains.

### Identifying Available Domains

Before specifying the host for your service URL, determine which domains are available to you. This helps in choosing the appropriate endpoint structure.

You will see that there are two possible domain types:

* Wildcard Domain: `*.your-organization.com`
* Standard Domain: `your-organization.com`

The approach to constructing the URL will differ based on what type of domain we are using.

### Constructing the URL

**a) Wildcard Domain**:

For wildcard domains, specify the unique identifier before the `.your-organization.com` part. For example, `your-site-name.your-organization.com`.

**b) Standard Domain**:

For standard domains, specify the unique identifier after the `your-organization.com` part. For example, `your-organization.com/your-site-name`.
