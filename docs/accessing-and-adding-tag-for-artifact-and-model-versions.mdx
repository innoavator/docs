title: "Accessing and Adding version alias for Artifact and Model Versions"
description: "Now you can add a version alias for each artifact or model version, this alias will act as a unique identifier to access the model or artifact."
---

In this guide, we will see how to add a version alias for the artifact or model, but before that, there are a few things to consider.

* The version alias must be unique across artifacts, so you cannot have the same version alias for two different artifacts or model versions within the same parent artifact or model.
* Alias will not replace the version but they will be accessible with the version, you can still access the artifact version by version number.

## Adding version alias via Python SDK

* You can add a version alias via Python SDK by following the way
* The version alias should start with 'v' followed by alphanumeric and it can include '.' and '-' in between (e.g. v1.0.0, v1-prod, v3-dev, etc)

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.ml import get_client

  client = get_client()

  artifact_version = client.log_artifact(ml_repo="", name="", artifact_paths=[])
  artifact_version.version_alias = "v0.0.1" #It should start with 'v'

  artifact_version.update()
  ```
</CodeGroup>
