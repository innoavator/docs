### What is TFY Agent?

* TFY Agent runs on the compute plane cluster and connects the cluster to the control plane.
* TFY Agent allows the control plane to deploy applications (Service, Job, SSH Server, etc.) and track their status.
* TFY Agent **does not** require an open endpoint (Load balancer Service or Node Port) in your cluster.
  * TFY Agent initiates secure WebSocket connections to the control plane, which uses these connections for all activities.

### How is TFY Agent installed in the cluster?

* [TFY Agent is installed in the cluster using a public Helm Chart.](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/tree/main/charts/tfy-agent)

### Architecture

![](/images/docs/1e29ced-image.png)

* TFY Agent consists of two parts: TFY Agent and TFY Agent Proxy. Each runs independently and uses a secure WebSocket connection to connect to the control plane.

#### TFY Agent

* TFY Agent streams the state of the compute plane cluster to the control plane. This state includes [but is not limited to](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-clusterrole.yaml) the status of Nodes, Pods, Argo Applications, etc., in the cluster.

#### TFY Agent Proxy

* TFY Agent Proxy enables the control plane to access the compute plane cluster's Kubernetes API server and other [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
  * This enables the control plane to create namespace (Workspace) and deploy applications to the compute plane cluster.

### Authorization

* The [TFY Agent helm chart](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/tree/main/charts/tfy-agent) uses [Kubernetes RBAC objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) to set up authorization rules for both the TFY Agent and TFY Agent Proxy.

#### TFY Agent

* TFY Agent runs [informers](https://macias.info/entry/202109081800_k8s_informers.md) to stream kubernetes resource changes and sends it to the control plane.
* To run informers, the TFY Agent must be able to list and watch those [resource types](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-clusterrole.yaml) across [all the namespaces](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-clusterrolebinding.yaml) in the cluster.
  * The `config.allowedNamespaces` field on the helm chart allows you to configure a list of allowed namespaces. TFY Agent will filter out any namespaced resource's update if the resource is not part of the allowed namespaces.
    * <CodeGroup>
        ```bash bash
        config:
          tenantName: your-tenant-name
          controlPlaneURL: your-controlplane-url
          clusterTokenSecret: your-cluster-token-secret
          allowedNamespaces:
            - tfy-agent
            - argocd
            - your-namespace
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

#### TFY Agent Proxy

* By default, the TFY Agent Proxy enables the control plane to access all resources on the compute cluster.

##### Strict Mode

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  config:
    tenantName: your-tenant-name
    controlPlaneURL: your-controlplane-url
    clusterTokenSecret: your-cluster-token-secret
  tfyAgentProxy:
    clusterRole:
      strictMode: true
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* If you want to give minimum authorization, please set the field `tfyAgentProxy.clusterRole.strictMode` to `true` on the helm chart.
* In this mode, we set up minimum required authorization rules for the control plane to function correctly.
* If you give a list of allowed namespaces using the `config.allowedNamespaces` field, we will always run on strict mode, regardless of the value of the `tfyAgentProxy.clusterRole.strictMode` field.
* In strict mode, we allow the control plane to create namespaces (Workspace) in the cluster. But if you give a list of allowed namespaces using the `config.allowedNamespaces` field, the control plane [will not be allowed](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-proxy-clusterrole-cs.yaml) to create new namespaces.

###### Cluster Scope resource access

* [This file](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-proxy-clusterrole-cs.yaml) documents all the authorization rules we set for the resources for which we require cluster-scope access.
* Note that if you have configured a list of allowed namespaces, the control plane cannot create any new namespace in the cluster.

###### Namespace Scope resource access

* [This file](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-proxy-clusterrole-cs.yaml) documents all the authorization rules we set for the resources the control plane can work with namespace-scope access.
* If you give a list of allowed namespaces using the `config.allowedNamespaces` field, we [setup role binding](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-proxy-rolebinding-ns.yaml) only for those namespaces.
* If the list of allowed namespaces is empty. We set up [cluster-wide access](https://github.com/truefoundry/infra-charts/blob/main/charts/tfy-agent/templates/tfy-agent-proxy-clusterrolebinding-ns.yaml) for these namespaced resources.
