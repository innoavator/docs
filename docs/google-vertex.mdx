# Supported Models

Currently TrueFoundry LLM Gateway supports text and embedding models from Vertex AI.

Some of these models support function calling and sending files like images or documents attached to their messages and TrueFoundry LLM Gateway also supports the same. Support for Vertex AI models like image generation, audio are coming soon on TrueFoundry LLM Gateway.

## Model ID

While adding models to LLM Gateway, you need to provide the Vertex Model ID. This can be obtained from the models page on Vertex.

While adding Google models like Gemini or Gemma, you can simply provide the model ID in the form. For example, you'd fill `gemini-1.5-flash` for Gemini 1.5 Flash model.

While adding models from other Vertex partners like Anthropic or Mistral, you need to provide the model ID in the `<partner>/<vertex-model-id`. For example, `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022`.
