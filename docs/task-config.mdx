title: "Task Config"
description: "Each task takes a task_config parameter which is used to define the config like resource the task execution will require, the python version, libraries, apt packages, cuda version, etc. for the task."
---

### Things you can define in task config

* **env**: you can pass the environment variables as `env` in task config, where `env` is a dictionary of key-value pairs.
* **service\_account**: you can pass the service\_account name in the task config which is necessary to save the input and output data of the task.
* **resources**: You can define the resource to allocate to each of the tasks, where you can define the cpu limit, storage limit, memory limit, GPU types, etc. You can refer to [this](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/resources) article for more information on each.
* **mounts**: You can attach volume mounts such as volume mounts, string mounts or secret mounts. You can learn more about mounts and how to use them in workflow in [this](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/attaching-mounts) guide.

### Types of task config

![](/images/docs/851482f280e5eccf0d22d41ec9fe4b567662b696503dcd067e24dbae97b3ea0a-image.png)

* There are two types of task config PythonTaskConfig and ContainerTaskConfig.

  * **PythonTaskConfig**: This task config can be passed in the normal python task in the task decorator. You can define the environment variables, [Resources](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/resources), service account, and the image spec in PythonTaskConfig. The image spec can be of two types TaskPythonBuild and TaskDockerFileBuild.

    * **TaskPythonBuild** is used when you do not have a Dockerfile and you want to build an image where you want to specify the pip packages, apt packages or requirements file path in the build spec, then TaskPythonBuild is used.
    * **TaskDockerFileBuild** is used when you already have a Dockerfile and you just want to build then you use TaskDockerFileBuild.

  * **ContainerTaskConfig**: This task config can be used when you already have a docker image and you want to use that as a task in the workflow directly or you have code uploaded on GitHub or the remote source. There you have a docker file which you want to use as a task in the workflow.

      ),
      resources=Resources(cpu_request=0.5, cpu_limit=0.5),

  )
