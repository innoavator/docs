# Concepts

The entities defined in MLFoundry can be understood from the diagram below.

* **ML-Repo** : An ML Repository is a collection of runs, models and artifacts which represents a high-level Machine Learning use-case. All access controls can be configured on the level of ml-repo. You can think of them as equivalent to Git repos - except for Machine learning artifacts.
* **Runs** : A run represents a single experiment which in the context of Machine Learning is one specific model (say Logistic Regression), with a fixed set of hyper-parameters. Metrics, and parameters (details below) are all logged under a specific run.
* **Models**: Model comprises of model file and some metadata. Each Model can have multiple versions.
* **Artifacts**: Artifact is a collection of files. Each Artifact can have multiple versions.

**With each run user can log metadata with the help of following :**

* **Parameters**: Parameters or HyperParameters that define your experiment and Machine Learning model. For example, `learning_rate, cache_size`.
* **Metric**: Metrics are values that help you to evaluate and compare different runs. For example, `accuracy, f1 score`.
* **Tags**: Tags are labels for a run. A tag is represented by a string tag name and value. For example, `env`.
