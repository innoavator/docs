TrueFoundry API Keys allow you to programmatically interact and perform actions on the TrueFoundry platform either using the [CLI / Python SDK](doc:setup) or [HTTP API](https://docs.truefoundry.com/reference) . Additionally they also allow you to access models via the [AI Gateway](doc:ai-gateway).

> This API Key can be provided to CLI / Python SDK via the `TFY_API_KEY` environment variable

There are two types of API Keys

* Personal Access Tokens
* Virtual Accounts

## Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens have the same exact set of permissions that your current logged in user has.

<Info>
  Personal Access Tokens mirror the exact same set of permissions of your current user. Thus it might be too permissive in a production environment
</Info>

## Virtual Accounts

Virtual Accounts allow creating API Keys with limited permissions and expiration date, thus making them ideal for production settings or using them in C/I Actions
