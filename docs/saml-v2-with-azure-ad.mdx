# Configure SAML v2 for Azure AD/Microsoft Entra ID

This documentation will guide you in configuring SAML v2 IdP for Azure AD/Microsoft Entra ID. In this case, TrueFoundry will act as Service Provider (SP) to Azure AD (IdP). Functionally, the result will allow you to display a “Login with Azure AD” button on your TrueFoundry login page and connect via SAML to Azure AD users/applications.

* **Login URL**: This value can be obtained from your Azure AD Application as demonstrated below. You will want to copy the Login URL value from Azure AD into this field.
