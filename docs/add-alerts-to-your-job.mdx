## Pre-Requisites

Setup a `Notification Channel Integration`on the Integrations page. Please follow this [document](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/integration-provider-others) to add an integration.

Currently two types of Notification Channels are supported:

1. Slack (Webhook URL based): For this, please create a [webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for your slack and then add it as an integration in **Slack Provider Account**
2. Email (SMTP credentials Integration): This can be found in **Custom Provider Account.** You can configure the SMTP Credentials of the mail server, from\_email and to\_emails and use it to send notifications.

## How to Configure

### From UI

1. In the Job form, please click on "Show Advanced Fields" and find the "Alerts" section

2. Select your notification channel and the triggers (on\_start, on\_completion, on\_failure).

3. Click on Submit.

Once the Alerts are created you can see the alerts in your Slack/Email. Here is a sample Alert:
