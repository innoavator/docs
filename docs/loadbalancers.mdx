If you want to modify any of your load-balancer settings, you will have to edit this configuration according to the guide mentioned below.

## Modifying your load balancer configuration

The loadbalancer can be modified using annotations on the gateway object. Below is an example of possible modifications that you can do. To get a complete list of annoations - check [here](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/service/annotations/)

### AWS

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  gateway:
    annotations:
      # Denotes that this is a network load balancer. We use NLB so that TCP protocol can also be 
      # supported. Also, NLB has lower latency and costs than ALB (Application Load Balancer)
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb
      
      # This is the default setting - It makes the loadbalancer external. If you want to create an internal
      # load-balancer, you can remove this annotations
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "external"
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internet-facing"

      # Use this only when you want to make the loadbalancer internal. Else remove this annotation
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"

      # ACM cert arn to attach to the load balancer. If you have your own custom certificate, then you can remove this annotation. 
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:XXXXXXX:certificate/XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXXX
      
      # You can let these settings as it is
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: https
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-alpn-policy: HTTP2Preferred
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: tcp
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled: "true"
  tfyGateway:
    name: tfy-wildcard
    spec:
      servers:
        - tls:
            httpsRedirect: true
          port:
            name: http-tfy-wildcard
            number: 80
            protocol: HTTP
          hosts:
            - "*"
        - port:
            name: https-tfy-wildcard
            number: 443
            protocol: HTTP
          hosts:
            - "*"
      selector:
        istio: tfy-istio-ingress
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As mentioned above, if you want the loadbalancer to be external, add the following annotation:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "external"  
  service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you want it to be internal, the following annotation should be added:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internal"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you convert the load balancer from internal to external or vice-versa, the loadbalancer will be recreated and you will have to remap your DNS.

### GCP

The default configuration creates an external load-balancer:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  gateway:
    tolerations:
    - key: "cloud.google.com/gke-spot"
      value: "true"
      effect: NoSchedule
      operator: Equal
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 1
          preference:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: cloud.google.com/gke-spot
              values:
              - "true"
              operator: In
  tfyGateway:
    name: 'tfy-wildcard'
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: 'tfy-istio-ingress'
      servers:
      - hosts:
        - "*"
        port:
          name: http-tfy-wildcard
          number: 80
          protocol: HTTP
        tls:
          httpsRedirect: true
      - hosts:
        - "*"
        port:
          name: https-tfy-wildcard
          number: 443
          protocol: HTTP
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To make the loadbalancer internal, add the annotation as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  gateway:
    annotations:
      networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Azure

The default configuration creates an external load balancer with the below configuration

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  gateway:
    tolerations:
    - key: CriticalAddonsOnly
      value: "true"
      effect: NoSchedule
      operator: Equal
  tfyGateway:
    name: 'tfy-wildcard'
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: 'tfy-istio-ingress'
      servers:
      - hosts:
        - "*"
        port:
          name: http-tfy-wildcard
          number: 80
          protocol: HTTP
        tls:
          httpsRedirect: true
      - hosts:
        - "*"
        port:
          name: https-tfy-wildcard
          number: 443
          protocol: HTTP
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To make the load balancer internal

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  gateway:
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Generic

1. By default load balancer will be created without an external IP address in the case of generic cluster.

2. Run [metalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/) to assign an IP address to the load balancer.

3. Once the load balancer gets the IP address assign the certificates for it to terminate TLS traffic. For that you can use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) or bring your own certificates.

   1. Cert-manager is present as an add-on in the cluster, so you can manage and edit the configurations for it vey seamlessly through the platform itself.
   2. cert-manager connects with your DNS providers and creates a secret in the k8s cluster.
   3. If you bring your own certificates, they need to be in the form of k8s secret. Check how you can create [tls secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_create/kubectl_create_secret_tls/) in k8s.
   4. Secret should be created in the `istio-system` namespace.

4. Passing those secrets in the `tfy-istio-ingress` in `tfyGateway.spec.servers[1].tls.credentialName`
   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash bash
     tfyGateway:
       name: 'tfy-wildcard'
       spec:
         selector:
           istio: 'tfy-istio-ingress'
         servers:
         - hosts:
           - "*"
           port:
             name: http-tfy-wildcard
             number: 80
             protocol: HTTP
           tls:
             httpsRedirect: true
         - hosts:
           - "*"
           port:
             name: https-tfy-wildcard
             number: 443
             protocol: HTTP
           tls:
             mode: SIMPLE
             credentialName: <>
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

## Deploy multiple load balancers

Each installation of `tfy-istio-ingress` creates a load balancer. If you want to deploy multiple multiple load-balancers, for e.g. one internal and one external, you can clone the current `tfy-istio-ingress` application in the same namespace `istio-system`, change the `tfyGateway.Name` to something else other then default `tfy-wildcard` and update the `tfyGateway.spec.Selector` with the new name of the application.

For e.g. if you clone the `tfy-istio-ingress` a new application with the name `tfy-istio-ingress-1` will be created , update the `tfyGateway.Name` to a new name and the `tfyGateway.spec.Selector` to

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  tfyGateway:
    spec:
      selector:
        app: "tfy-istio-ingress-1"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once the ingress is installed, it will automatically create another loadbalancer whose IP you can get using `kubectl get svc -n istio-system`.

## Add authentication to all services behind a load balancer

We can configure Istio to apply authentication at a gateway level. This will work only if you are accessing the service using the DNS provided in Istio and not access the service directly from within the cluster. This process is a bit complicated, and you should only do this if you really want to enable authentication at an istio gateway level.

<Info />

1. Create a RequestAuthentication resource to ensure that the JWT issuer and Audience are correct.

   1. Authentication will be only done if there is an Authorization header. This is pass-through if no Authorization header is present in the Request or it gets an empty string after removing the prefix.

   ```
   apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
   kind: RequestAuthentication
   metadata:
     name: tfy-oauth2
     namespace: istio-system
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         istio: tfy-istio-ingress
     jwtRules:
     - issuer: "truefoundry.com"
       fromHeaders:
       - name: Authorization
         prefix: "Bearer "
       audiences:
         - <tenant_name_in_truefoundry>
       jwksUri: https://login.truefoundry.com/.well-known/jwks.json
       forwardOriginalToken: true
   ```

2. Create an AuthorizationPolicy that will reject any requests with an empty JWT.

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: tfy-oauth2
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: tfy-istio-ingress
  action: DENY
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        notRequestPrincipals: ["*"]
    to:
      - operation:
          ports:
            - "443" 
```

You can read the Istio docs: [https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/request\_authentication/](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/request_authentication/) for further customization or making it work with your own IdP.
