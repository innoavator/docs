# TrueFoundry CLI Library

TrueFoundry CLI library to help you interact with the platform programmatically by

* Interacting with the deployments side of TrueFoundry, enabling you to manage workspaces, deployments, applications, and view logs.
* Providing experiment tracking capabilities, allowing you to track ML experiments and interact with ML repositories within TrueFoundry.

# Setup for CLI

## Installation

<Info>
  * Python >= 3.8
</Info>

To install the **`Truefoundry CLI`** to enable both deployment and models functionality, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  pip install -U "truefoundry"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  By default just installing `truefoundry` does not include support to work with [Workflows](doc:workflow-concepts). To include support for Workflows install the `workflow` extra like so

  Shell

  ```
  pip install -U "truefoundry[workflow]"
  ```
</Info>

## Login

### Login by entering a Device Code

You can log in to TrueFoundry using Truefoundry CLI.

To log in to **TrueFoundry**, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  tfy login --host <your-truefoundry-host> # e.g. host: https://myorg.truefoundry.cloud
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will prompt you to open a URL and enter the displayed code

<Info>
  The value for `--host` is the first part of the url when you open the platform. This domain might be subdomain of your organization. The below example shows `https://myorg.truefoundry.cloud`

</Info>

### Login using API Key (Non-Interactive Mode)

For scenarios where code interacts with Truefoundry APIs or where opening a browser is not feasible, you can log in using the Truefoundry API Key.

To begin, [Generate a TrueFoundry API Key](doc:generating-truefoundry-api-keys). Once you have the API key, you can authenticate in these ways:

#### Option 1: Setting environment variables

Set the `TFY_API_KEY` and `TFY_HOST` environment variables.

* Set `TFY_HOST` to your Truefoundry host URL. e.g. `https://your-domain.truefoundry.com`
* Set `TFY_API_KEY` to your API key.

#### Option 2: Using the `login` command on CLI

When using the CLI, you can provide the API key directly within the command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  tfy login --host <your-truefoundry-host> --api-key <your-api-key>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Generate TrueFoundry API Key

TrueFoundry API comes in handy when you want to interact with the Platform programmatically. You can generate the API key by following the instructions below:

<Info>
  Your API Key is a sensitive piece of information, so handle it with care. **Never** share it with unauthorized individuals.
