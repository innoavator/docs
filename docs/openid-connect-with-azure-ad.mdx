# Configure OpenID Connect with Azure Active Directory/Microsoft Entra ID

Once you have completed this configuration you may enable an OpenID Connect “Login with Azure AD” button for TrueFoundry dashboard. See [Microsoft Entra ID - Register An App Quickstart Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) as an additional reference.

# Register a New Azure Active Directory Application

You will first need to login to the [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/).

Once logged in, navigate to **Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> New Registration** to create a new Azure Active Directory Application.

Here we have configured our application `Redirect URI`. Use redirect URL value as`https://login.truefoundry.com/oauth2/callback`.

Once the application has been created, note the `Application (client) ID` and the `Directory (tenant) ID`. These will be used respectively as the **Client Id** value and to construct the Issuer value in your TrueFoundry OpenID Connect Identity Provider configuration.

### Device Code Flow

To enable the Device Code login flow, follow the steps below:

* Navigate to `Authentication` tab under `Manage` section in your app registration page
* Scroll down to `Advanced settings` and enable `Allow public client flows`

# Create a New Azure Active Directory Application Secret

Navigate to **Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations ->\[Your Application] -> Certificates & secrets -> New client secret** to create a new Azure Active Directory Application Client Secret.

Note the `VALUE` of the created client secret. This will be used as the Client secret value in your TrueFoundry OpenID Connect Identity Provider configuration.

# Integrate with TrueFoundry

To integrate Azure AD with TrueFoundry, provide the following configuration to the truefoundry team via email:

* **Tenant ID**: Tenant or Directory ID of your Azure application.
* **Client ID**: Application ID of your Azure application
* **Client Secret**: Secret value of client secret created in the above step
