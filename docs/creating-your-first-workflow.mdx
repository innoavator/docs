title: "Creating your first workflow"
description: "In this guide we will create a simple workflow to return the sum of the square of all the elements in the list. following are the tasks we will be creating in the workflow"
---

1. Generate a list of numbers.
2. Calculate the square of each number in the list.
3. Sum the squared numbers.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the guide, make sure you have the following:

* **Truefoundry CLI**: Set up and configure the TrueFoundry CLI tool on your local machine by following the [Setup for CLI](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/setup) guide.
* **Workspace**: To deploy your workflow, you'll need a workspace. If you don't have one, you can create it using this guide: [Creating a Workspace](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/key-concepts#creating-a-workspace) or seek assistance from your cluster administrator.

## Creating the Workflow

Create a `workflow.py` where we will write the code for our workflow and place in the project root folder. (With other dependent files and requirements.txt)

### `workflow.py`

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.workflow import task, workflow, PythonTaskConfig, TaskPythonBuild
  from truefoundry.deploy import Resources

  cpu_task_config = PythonTaskConfig(
      # `TaskPythonBuild` helps specify the details of your Python Code.
      # These details will be used to templatize a DockerFile to build your Docker Image
      image=TaskPythonBuild(
          python_version="3.9",
          # Pip packages to install.`truefoundry[workflow]` is a mandatory dependency
          pip_packages=["truefoundry[workflow]==0.4.8"],
        	# Optionally pass the path to requirements.txt
          # requirements_path="requirements.txt"
      ),
      resources=Resources(cpu_request=0.5)
  )

  # Task 1: Generate a list of numbers
  @task(task_config=cpu_task_config)
  def generate_numbers(n: int) -> list[int]:
      return list(range(1, n + 1))

  # Task 2: Calculate the square of each number in the list
  @task(task_config=cpu_task_config)
  def square_numbers(numbers: list[int]) -> list[int]:
      return [x**2 for x in numbers]

  # Task 3: Sum the squared numbers
  @task(task_config=cpu_task_config)
  def sum_squares(squared_numbers: list[int]) -> int:
      return sum(squared_numbers)

  # Workflow: Orchestrate the tasks
  @workflow
  def simple_pipeline(n: int) -> int:
      numbers = generate_numbers(n=n)
      squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers=numbers)
      result = sum_squares(squared_numbers=squared_numbers)
      return result

  # Runs the pipeline locally
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      result = simple_pipeline(n=5)
      print(f"The sum of squares from 1 to 5 is: {result}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning />

You can also have [map tasks](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/creating-a-map-task) and [conditional tasks](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/conditional-task) in your workflow. You can also run [raw containers](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/container-task) as tasks.

Now run the below command in the terminal to deploy your workflow, replace `<workfspace-fqn>` with the [workspace fqn](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/key-concepts#getting-workspace-fqn) which you can find on the UI.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  tfy deploy workflow \
    --name my-workflow-name \
    --file workflow.py \
    --workspace_fqn "Paste your workspace FQN here"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## View your deployed workflow

* You can view the deployed workflow by going to the workflow tab on dashboard.
