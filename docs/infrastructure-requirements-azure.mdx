#### Access Policies

* ACR - We use admin username and password. This is for the platform to be able to push and pull from ACR.
* Blob storage - We use connection string to get access. The blob storage is used to store model artifacts.
* Cluster Diagnostic Setting - We use the "Monitoring Reader" role to access the cluster autoscaler logs in Log Analytics.
