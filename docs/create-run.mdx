# Runs

A run represents a single experiment which in the context of Machine Learning is one specific model (say Logistic Regression), with a fixed set of hyper-parameters. Metrics, and parameters (details below) are all logged under a specific run.

# Creating Runs in Truefoundry

A run is an entity that represents a single experiment. Create a run at the beginning of your script or notebook to start capturing system metrics.

<Info>
  If you don't have a ML Repo already, you'd need to create the ML Repo either from the [Creating a ML Repo](doc:key-concepts#creating-an-ml-repo) or with [`create_ml_repo` ](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/mlfoundry#kbdfunctionkbd-create_ml_repo)function
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.ml import get_client

  client = get_client()
  run = client.create_run(ml_repo="iris-demo", run_name="svm-model")
  # Your code here.
  run.end()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You can organize multiple runs under a single ml\_repo. For example, the run `svm-model` will be created under the ml\_repo `iris-sklearn-example`.

You can view these runs in the TrueFoundry dashboard.

# Accessing Runs in TrueFoundry

To interact with runs in Truefoundry, you can use the provided methods in the TrueFoundryClient class. Here are the different possibilities to access runs:

### Get a Run by ID

To retrieve an existing run by its ID, use the[ `get_run_by_id`](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/mlfoundry#kbdfunctionkbd-get_run_by_id) method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  client = TrueFoundryClient()  
  run = client.get_run_by_id("run_id_here")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Get a Run by Fully Qualified Name (FQN)

If you have the fully qualified name (FQN) of a run, which follows the pattern tenant\_name/ml\_repo/run\_name, you can use the `get_run_by_fqn` method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  client = TrueFoundryClient()  
  run = client.get_run_by_fqn("tenant_name/ml_repo/run_name")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Get All Runs for a Project

To retrieve all the runs' names and IDs for a project, use the [`get_all_runs`](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/mlfoundry#kbdfunctionkbd-get_all_runs) method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  client = TrueFoundryClient()  
  runs_df = client.get_all_runs(ml_repo="project_name_here")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Search Runs

You can search for runs that match specific criteria using the [`search_runs`](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/mlfoundry#kbdfunctionkbd-search_runs) method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  client = TrueFoundryClient()  
  runs = client.search_runs(  
      ml_repo="project_name_here",  
      filter_string="metrics.accuracy > 0.75",  
      order_by=["metric.accuracy DESC"],  
  )
  for run in runs:  
      print(run)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# FAQs

#### What is a ml\_repo?

A ml\_repo embodies the high-level goal of the experiments, like "predicting the sentiment of product reviews". To reach the goal, you can experiment with different machine learning algorithms with different parameters. A single run represents a single experiment. TrueFoundry helps you organize these runs and find the best-performing ones under a ml\_repo.

#### How can I create a ml\_repo?

A ml\_repo is automatically created when you call the `create_run` method. A ml\_repo is identified by it's owner and name.

#### Can anyone create a run under my ml\_repo?

No. TrueFoundry provides ml\_repo-level authorization. If someone in your team wants to view or create a run under your ml\_repo, you need to add them as a collaborator to your ml\_repo.

#### How can I create a run under a ml\_repo owned by someone else?

You can pass the ml\_repo argument in the the create run. You should at least have `WRITE` permission for the ml\_repo. If you don't have write access to the ml\_repo, the admin needs to provide you atleast `WRITE` permission to the ml\_repo.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash

  client.create_ml_repo("iris-demo")

  run = client.create_run(
      ml_repo="iris-demo",
      run_name="svm-model",
  )
  # Your code here.
  run.end()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Can I use runs as a context manager?

Yes, we can use runs as a context manager. A run will be automatically ended after the execution exits the `with` block.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  client.create_ml_repo("iris-demo")

  run = client.create_run(ml_repo="iris-demo", run_name="svm-model")
  with run:
      # Your code here.
      ...

  # No need to call run.end()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Are run names unique?

Yes. run names under a ml\_repo are unique. If a run name already exists, we add a suffix to make it unique. If you do not pass a run name while creating a run, we generate a random name.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.ml import get_client

  client = get_client()
  run = client.create_run(ml_repo="iris-demo")

  print(run.run_name)
  run.end()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### How runs are identified?

Runs are identified by by their `id`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.ml import get_client

  client = get_client()
  run = client.create_run(ml_repo="iris-demo")

  print(run.run_id)
  run.end()
  ```
</CodeGroup>
