## Store Secrets in your Secret Store with Truefoundry

Suppose your backend service needs to load a database password and an API key for an external service. You can create a secret group for that backend service and add the database password and the API key as secrets under that secret group. To do so, follow the steps below:

## Collaborators & Access control

There are 3 roles possible in Secret groups - Secret Group Admin, Secret Group Editor, and Secret Group Viewer. Each granting permissions as shown below:

By default, a tenant admin has access to all secret groups. For tenant members and teams you need to assign roles for each secret group.
