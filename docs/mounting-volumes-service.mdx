title: "Mounting Files"
description: "In some applications, you might need a file to be present at a certain path for the application to work. Or you have data in directories that need to be mounted for the application to work. TrueFoundry allows you to mount files in the following ways:"
---

## Mount Volume

If your application needs access to multiple files of data or multiple directories, you can use a volume to store the data and then mount the volume at the desired path. You can learn more about Volumes [here](doc:introduction-to-volume).

To use a persistent volume, we will first need to create one and then attach it to your deployment. You can learn how to create volumes using the [Creating a Volume](doc:creating-a-volume) guide

### Mount Volume through the User Interface (UI)

### Mount Volume using the Python SDK

You can add the following in your **`deploy.py`** file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.deploy import Build, Service, DockerFileBuild, VolumeMount

  service = Service(
      name="my-service",
      image=Build(build_spec=DockerFileBuild()),
      ports=[
        Port(
          host="your_host",
          port=8501
        )
      ]
  +  mounts=[
  +    VolumeMount(
  +      mount_path="/model", #or your desired path
  +      volume_fqn="your-volume-fqn"
  +    )
  +  ]
  )
  service.deploy(workspace_fqn="YOUR_WORKSPACE_FQN")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Mount Secret

This is similar to string mount, except, in this case, you will directly provide a TrueFoundry Secret FQN. You can read more about Secrets and how to create them [here](doc:secrets).

The content in the secret will be dumped into a file and mounted in the provided location. A good usecase of this is for mounting Google credentials file which you might need to access Google services.

### Mount secret through the User Interface (UI)

### Mount secret using the Python SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.deploy import Build, Service, DockerFileBuild, Port, SecretMount

  service = Service(
      name="my-service",
      image=Build(build_spec=DockerFileBuild()),
      ports=[
        Port(
          host="your_host",
          port=8501
        )
      ],
  +    mount = [  
  +    	SecretMount(
  +      	mount_path="/etc/google-credentials.json", 
  +        data="tfy-secret://user:my-secret-group:my-secret"
  +      )  
  +    ]
  )
  service.deploy(workspace_fqn="YOUR_WORKSPACE_FQN")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Mount String

This can be useful if you need a small configuration file to be present at a certain file path. To configure this, you need to provide the path where it needs to be mounted and the string data that should be in that file. A good example can be a Nginx configuration file that you can mount along with the Nginx docker image.

### Mount string through the User Interface (UI)

### Mount string using the Python SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.deploy import Build, Service, DockerFileBuild, Port, StringDataMount

  service = Service(
      name="my-service",
      image=Build(build_spec=DockerFileBuild()),
      ports=[
        Port(
          host="your_host",
          port=8501
        )
      ],
  +    mount = [
  +    	StringDataMount(
  +      	mount_path="/etc/nginx/conf.d/my_config.conf",
  +        data="server { listen 80; }"
  +      )
  +    ]  
  )
  service.deploy(workspace_fqn="YOUR_WORKSPACE_FQN")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Using mounted files in your deployment

Once you have attached a file to your deployment, you can use it in your deployment like any other file. For example, if you mounted the file to `/etc/config.json`, you can access the file in the `/etc/config.json` path

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  import json

  with open("/etc/config.json", "r") as f:
    config_data = json.load(f)

  # Access specific values from the config data dictionary
  api_key = config_data["api_key"]
  database_url = config_data["database_url"]

  # Use these values in your application logic
  print(f"API key: {api_key}")
  print(f"Database URL: {database_url}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>
