title: "Overview"
description: "A Truefoundry Service represents a continuously running application that typically provides a set of APIs for interaction. Services can be dynamically scaled based on incoming traffic or resource demands."
---

Services are perfect for scenarios where real-time responses are essential, such as:

* Hosting Real-time Model Inference (e.g., Flask, FastAPI)
* Fueling Dynamic Website Backends
* Creating Model Demos (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio)

## Important Considerations for Service Deployment

When deploying a service, you'll typically expose APIs on specific ports. These considerations are essential when deploying a service:

1. Dockerize the code to be deployed
2. Specify the ports for service exposure - [Define Ports and Domains](doc:define-ports-and-domains).
3. \[Optional] Map domains to the ports to enable communication with other applications - [Define Ports and Domains](doc:define-ports-and-domains).
4. Define the resources requirements for your service - [Define Resources](doc:resources)
5. \[Optional] Define environment variables and secrets to inject into the code - [Environment Variables and Secrets](doc:environment-variables-and-secrets-services).
6. \[Optional] Set up an autoscaling policy for production workloads - [Autoscaling](doc:scaling-and-autoscaling).
7. \[Best Practice] Define Liveness/Readiness Probes - [Liveness/Readiness Probe](doc:liveness-readiness-probe).
8. \[Best Practice] Establish a rollout strategy - [Rollout Strategy](doc:rollout-strategy).
9. \[Optional] Mount files or volumes to your service - [Mounting Volumes and Files](doc:mounting-volumes-service).
10. [Configure Monitoring Dashboards](doc:monitor-your-service#set-up-monitoring-and-alerting-through-grafana)
11. [Set up Alerting](doc:set-up-alerts)
12. [Update, Rollback, and Promote your Service](doc:update-rollback-promote-your-service)
13. [Set up CI/CD for your Service](doc:setting-up-cicd-for-your-service)
14. [Access data from S3 or other clouds](doc:access-data-from-s3-or-other-clouds-services)

## Deploy Your First Service

To deploy your first service, choose one of the following guides based on the location of your service code:

* [Deploy Service from a public Github repository](doc:deploy-service-from-a-public-github-repository).
* [Deploy Service from your local machine](doc:deploy-service-using-python-sdk).
