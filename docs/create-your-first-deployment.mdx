1. Kickstart your machine learning journey by launching a Jupyter Notebook to explore and experiment with your ideas.

   * [Launch a Notebook](doc:launch-notebooks)
   * [Launch SSH Server and Connect with VS Code](doc:launch-an-ssh-server)

2. Once your model is ready for training, execute a model training job from within the Notebook using the Python SDK. Or you can push your training code to a Github Repository and deploy directly from a public Github repository

   * [Deploy a Job from Github Repo](doc:deploy-job-from-a-public-github-repository)
   * [Deploy a Job using Python SDK](doc:deploy-job-using-python-sdk)

3. Seamlessly log your trained model to the TrueFoundry Model Registry, which is backed by a secure blob storage service like S3, GCS, or Azure Container.

   * [Log your trained model](doc:ml-repo-quickstart)

4. Deploy the logged model as a:

   1. Real-time API Service: Deploy your model as a real-time API Service to serve predictions in real-time, either from a public Github repository or from a local-machine / notebook

      * [Deploy a Service from Github Repo](doc:deploy-service-from-a-public-github-repository)
      * [Deploy a Service using Python SDK](doc:deploy-service-using-python-sdk)

   2. Batch Inference Service: Deploy your model for batch inference to process large datasets efficiently by deploying it as a Job

   3. Async Service: Handle requests asynchronously using a queue to store intermediate requests by deploying an Async Service
      * [Deploy an Async Service](doc:deploy-your-first-asyncservice)

5. LLM Testing and Deployment: Evaluate and compare the performance of various LLMs using TrueFoundry's LLM Gateway capabilities. Once you've selected the desired LLM, deploy it with ease using pre-configured settings

   * [Compare various LLM's using LLM Gateway](doc:integrate-openai-to-gateway)
   * [Deploy a LLM](doc:deploying-an-llm-model-from-the-model-catalogue)

6. LLM Finetuning: Leverage TrueFoundry's LLM finetuning capabilities to tailor LLMs to your specific needs and data.

   * [Finetune a LLM on your own data](doc:finetuning-a-model-from-the-model-catalogue)
