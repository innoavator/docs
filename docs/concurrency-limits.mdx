title: "Set Concurrency Limit"
description: "TrueFoundry allows you to set a limit on how many runs of a Job can run concurrently (provided sufficient resources are available in the cluster). By default, this is set to  which allows an unlimited number of runs concurrently."
---

You might want to limit the maximum number of concurrent runs of a job in case we don't want to bring the resources up at the same time - for e.g. if you only have quotas for 3 GPU machines, you can only run 3 jobs in parallel. So the concurrent limit can be set to 3 in that case.

<Info>
  This will be true in most cases unless the docker image pull time is close to or greater than the job execution time.
</Info>

This can also be a requirement if only one run of a job should run at a single point - this can be true if you are reading / writing from a volume and only one source can be writing at a point to avoid corruption. We can set the concurrency limit to 1 in this case.

If more instances of a job are triggered than the specified concurrency limit, the excess jobs are placed in a queue and executed sequentially once available slots become free.

## Configuring Concurrency Limit for Job

Here, we'll explore two different methods of configuring concurrency limit for your job:

* Through the User Interface (UI)
* Using the Python SDK

### Through the User Interface (UI)

### Using the Python SDK

In your Job deployment code **`deploy.py`**, include the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.deploy import Build, Job, PythonBuild

  job = Job(
      name="iris-train-job",
      image=Build(
          build_spec=PythonBuild(
              command="python train.py",
              requirements_path="requirements.txt",
          )
      ),
  +    concurrency_limit=3,
  )
  job.deploy(workspace_fqn="...")
  ```
</CodeGroup>
