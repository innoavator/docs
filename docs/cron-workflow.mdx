title: "Creating a Cron Workflow"
description: "A cron workflow is a type of workflow that is scheduled to run at specific intervals, similar to how cron jobs work in Unix-like systems. It allows you to automate the execution of workflows based on a predefined schedule, which can be expressed using cron syntax. Cron jobs are always scheduled in UTC timezone."
---

The cron job can be scheduled be passing the `execution_configs` in the workflow decorator

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.workflow import workflow, ExecutionConfig

  @workflow(
      execution_configs=[
          ExecutionConfig(
              schedule="*/10 * * * *",
          )
      ]
  )
  def your_workflow():
      ...
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As you can see we have defined the execution config where the schedule is set to run every 10 minutes. The expression is define in cron expression format.
