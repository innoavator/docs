<Info>
  Before you can create an ML Repo, you'd need to connect one or more Blob Storages (S3, GCS, Azure Blob, MinIO, etc) to store artifacts and models associated with a ML Repo. If this one time setup is already done, you can skip to next section

  You can refer to one of the following pages to connect your blob storage to TrueFoundry

  * [AWS S3](doc:integration-provider-aws)
  * [Google Cloud Storage](doc:integration-provider-gcp)
  * [Azure Blob Storage](doc:integration-provider-azure)
  * Any S3 API Compatible Storage
</Info>

You can then create an ML Repo from the ML Repo's tab in the Platform.

Now you are all set to start

* [Creating a run](doc:create-run)
* [Log and Get Data](doc:log-and-get-data)
* [Log and Get Models](doc:log-models)
* [Log and Get Artifacts](doc:log-artifacts)
