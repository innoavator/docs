description: "TrueFoundry also supports integrating with a lot more integration providers like DockerHub, OpenAI, JFrog, TTL, Quay, Slack, Email (Custom Provider) etc."

To integrate any of the above services, you simply need to add your provider account details and add the available integrations for the same. Let's try adding a Docker Registry from DockerHub to learn how this works:

**Share access with users, teams or everyone in your TrueFoundry account**

As shown in the previous slides, you can share access of each integration with users, teams or everyone in your TrueFoundry account. This would allow them to view and use the integration. Only tenant-admins can edit the integrations.

Similarly you can integrate with other provider accounts.
