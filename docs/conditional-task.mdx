title: "Creating a Conditional Task"
description: "A special type of task that enables conditional execution paths within a workflow. Conditional tasks allow the workflow to choose different execution paths based on the outcome of a previous task or variable."
---

Conditional task are typically structured with a condition followed by one or more possible execution paths (if-else branches).

## Example

This is how the flow will be of the given example workflow

![](/images/docs/ba3372c4f9d9a94415560dd5a33233d7d01ca329258e145d3d50f4fcb0af1fbf-image.png)

## Code

Create file names `workflow.py` and paste the following contents into the file:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.workflow import task, workflow, PythonTaskConfig, TaskPythonBuild, conditional

  task_config = PythonTaskConfig(image=TaskPythonBuild(
          python_version="3.11",
          pip_packages=["truefoundry[workflow]==0.4.8"],
      )
  )

  @task(task_config=task_config)
  def generate_number() -> int:
      return 7

  @task(task_config=task_config)
  def process_low() -> str:
      return "Low number processing"

  @task(task_config=task_config)
  def process_high() -> str:
      return "High number processing"

  @workflow
  def conditional_workflow() -> str:
      number = generate_number()

      result = conditional("branch")\
          .if_(number < 5).then(process_low())\
          .else_().then(process_high())

      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now run the below command in the terminal to deploy your workflow, replace `<workfspace-fqn>` with the [workspace fqn](https://docs.truefoundry.com/docs/key-concepts#getting-workspace-fqn) which you can find on the UI.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  tfy deploy workflow \
    --name conditional-example-wf \
    --file workflow.py \
    --workspace_fqn "Paste your workspace FQN here"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example:

* generate\_number: A task that generates a number.
* process\_low and process\_high: Tasks that process the number based on whether it is low or high.
* conditional: A branch node that checks if the number is less than 5. If true, it executes process\_low, otherwise it executes process\_high.

* When you see the graph of a workflow containing the conditional task then you can see that the green box here represents the conditional task and the green color indicates that the task execution was successful.
