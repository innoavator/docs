### Create a ML Repo

<Info>
  Before you can create an ML Repo, you'd need to connect one or more Blob Storages (S3, GCS, Azure Blob, MinIO, etc) to store artifacts and models associated with a ML Repo. If this one time setup is already done, you can skip to next section

  You can refer to one of the following pages to connect your blob storage to TrueFoundry

  * [AWS S3](doc:integration-provider-aws)
  * [Google Cloud Storage](doc:integration-provider-gcp)
  * [Azure Blob Storage](doc:integration-provider-azure)
  * Any S3 API Compatible Storage
</Info>

You can then create an ML Repo from the ML Repo's tab in the Platform.

### Create a run and start tracking

Initialize a new run. This run will now appear on the TrueFoundry dashboard under ML Repos Tab.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  from truefoundry.ml import get_client

  client = get_client()
  run = client.create_run(ml_repo="iris-demo", run_name="svm-model")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Track parameters

Save hyperparameters for your experiment.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  run.log_params({"learning_rate": 0.001})
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Track metrics

Save metrics for your model.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  run.log_metrics({"accuracy": 0.7, "loss": 0.6})
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### End a run and stop tracking

After completion of your experiment, you can end a run. This function marks the run as “finished” and stops tracking system metrics.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  run.end()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new ML repository. It is now ready for use, and you can start populating it with your data, code, models, and other related resources.

## Login without manual interaction ( Non-Interactive Mode )

TrueFoundry offers a convenient option to automate login through the command-line interface (CLI) for integration within your scripts. This non-interactive approach utilizes environment variables, eliminating the need for manual input (approving through clicking the Approve button in the browser that opens)

In non-interactive mode, you can set environment variables to automate the login process. To do this, set the following environment variables:

* `TFY_API_KEY`: Your TrueFoundry API key. You can obtain your API key by referring to the [API Key Generation Documentation](doc:generate-api-key).
* `TFY_HOST`: The host URL of your MLFoundry instance, e.g., [https://your-domain.truefoundry.com](https://your-domain.truefoundry.com).
