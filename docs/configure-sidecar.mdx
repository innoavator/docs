We will have to provide the url in your service to which the sidecar can send the HTTP request. For e.g. if you have a path called `/predict` in your service and you are running it on port 8000, the destination url will be `http://0.0.0.0:8000/predict`

<Info />

The port number is the same as what you provided in the Ports section in the deployment form. The reason you have to provide it here again since you might have multiple ports and you want the sidecar to call one of the ports specified.
